GITIGNORE CONFIGURATION SUMMARY
================================

Updated: October 9, 2025

OVERVIEW
--------
The .gitignore file has been configured to exclude deployment scripts and 
markdown documentation files from being pushed to git repositories.

IGNORED FILE CATEGORIES
-----------------------

1. DEPLOYMENT SCRIPTS
   - scripts/deploy*.sh
   - scripts/cleanup*.sh
   - scripts/nuke*.sh
   - scripts/monitor-costs.sh
   - scripts/cost-protection-guardian.sh
   - scripts/daily-cost-check.sh
   - scripts/setup-cost-protection.sh
   - scripts/secure-deploy.sh
   - scripts/setup-credentials.sh
   - scripts/setup-secure-credentials.sh
   - scripts/*autoscaling*.sh
   - scripts/quick-portfolio-demo.sh
   - scripts/resource-loop-through.sh

2. DOCUMENTATION FILES
   - All *.md files (markdown)
   - Exception: /README.md (root README is tracked)
   - All files in docs/ directory
   - All files in old-files-backup/ directory

3. AUTO-GENERATED FILES
   - auto-cleanup.sh
   - cleanup.pid

4. EXISTING IGNORES (unchanged)
   - Terraform state files
   - Environment files (.env)
   - Credentials and secrets
   - Log files
   - Temporary files
   - IDE configuration

TRACKED FILES
-------------
The following file types WILL be tracked by git:

1. ROOT README
   - /README.md (project root only)

2. KUBERNETES MANIFESTS
   - k8s/**/*.yaml
   - k8s/kustomization.yaml

3. TERRAFORM FILES
   - terraform/**/*.tf
   - terraform/**/*.tfvars (if not sensitive)

4. APPLICATION CODE
   - docker/api/*.py
   - lambda-code/*.py

5. CONFIGURATION
   - config/**/*.yaml
   - config/**/*.env (templates only, not actual .env)

VERIFICATION
------------
To verify files are being ignored:

  git check-ignore -v <filename>

Example:
  git check-ignore -v scripts/cost-protection-guardian.sh

Expected output:
  .gitignore:64:scripts/cost-protection-guardian.sh

To see what will be committed:
  git status --short

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

1. PREVIOUSLY TRACKED FILES
   Files that were already tracked by git before adding gitignore rules
   will continue to show in git status until you commit their deletion.
   This is normal git behavior.

2. NEW FILES
   Any new files matching gitignore patterns will be automatically
   ignored and won't appear in git status.

3. ROOT README EXCEPTION
   The root /README.md is explicitly allowed (tracked) while all other
   *.md files are ignored.

4. FORCE ADD IF NEEDED
   If you need to add an ignored file, use:
   git add -f <filename>

RATIONALE
---------

Deployment scripts are excluded because:
- May contain environment-specific configurations
- Could have sensitive deployment logic
- Are typically customized per deployment environment
- Should not be shared in public repositories

Documentation files are excluded because:
- May contain internal notes and procedures
- Could have sensitive information
- Are typically environment-specific
- Root README is kept for project overview

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

1. Keep the root README.md for project documentation
2. Store deployment scripts locally or in private repos
3. Use environment variables for sensitive configurations
4. Document deployment procedures separately
5. Share only infrastructure code (Terraform, Kubernetes YAML)

STATUS: CONFIGURED AND TESTED
