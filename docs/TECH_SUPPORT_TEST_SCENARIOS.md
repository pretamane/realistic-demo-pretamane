### **Test Steps**

#### **Step 1: Document Upload**
```bash
# Create a legal document
cat > legal-contract-2025.txt << 'DOC_EOF'
CONFIDENTIAL LEGAL DOCUMENT
===========================
Client: Acme Corporation
Case Number: LC-2025-001
Document Type: Service Agreement

DOC_EOF

# Upload the document
curl -X POST -F "file=@legal-contract-2025.txt" \
  http://localhost:8080/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" | jq .
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "filename": "legal-contract-2025.txt",
  "path": "/mnt/efs/uploads/legal-contract-2025.txt",
  "size": 450,
  "status": "ready_for_processing"
}
```

#### **Step 2: Document Processing**
```bash
# Process the legal document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/process/legal-contract-2025.txt | jq .
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "message": "File processed successfully",
  "original": "/mnt/efs/uploads/legal-contract-2025.txt",
  "processed": "/mnt/efs/processed/processed_legal-contract-2025.txt",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

#### **Step 3: Audit Trail Verification**
```bash
# Check audit logs
curl -s http://localhost:8080/logs | jq '.logs[] | select(.file == "activity.log") | .content'
```

**Expected Result:** Should show entries for file upload and processing activities.

#### **Step 4: Storage Verification**
```bash
# Verify file exists in EFS
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=portfolio-demo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  -- ls -la /mnt/efs/uploads/ | grep legal-contract

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=portfolio-demo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  -- ls -la /mnt/efs/processed/ | grep legal-contract
```

**Expected Result:** Both original and processed files should be visible in their respective directories.

MED_EOF

# Upload medical record
curl -X POST -F "file=@patient-record-12345.txt" \
  http://localhost:8080/upload | jq .
```

#### **Step 2: HIPAA Compliance Check**
```bash
# Verify secure storage
curl -s http://localhost:8080/storage/status | jq '.efs_status'

# Check file encryption status
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=portfolio-demo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  -- ls -la /mnt/efs/uploads/ | grep patient-record
```

#### **Step 3: Backup Verification**
```bash
# Check S3 sync status (look for sync logs)
kubectl logs -l app=portfolio-demo -c s3-sync --tail=20
```

**Expected Result:** S3 sync should be attempting to backup files (may show credential errors, but sync process should be running).

## 🏦 **Scenario 3: Financial Document Processing**

### **Business Context**
A bank needs to process loan applications and financial documents. The system must handle high-volume processing with real-time monitoring and alerting.

### **Test Steps**

#### **Step 1: High-Volume Document Upload**
```bash
# Create multiple loan applications
for i in {1..5}; do
  cat > loan-application-$i.txt << LOAN_EOF
LOAN APPLICATION #$i
===================
Applicant: Customer $i
Loan Amount: \$$((100000 + i * 50000))
Loan Type: Personal Loan
Credit Score: $((650 + i * 10))
Employment: Full-time
Income: \$$((50000 + i * 10000))/year
Status: PENDING_REVIEW

LOAN_EOF

  # Upload each document
  curl -X POST -F "file=@loan-application-$i.txt" \
    http://localhost:8080/upload | jq '.filename'
done
```

#### **Step 2: Batch Processing**
```bash
# Process all loan applications
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Processing loan-application-$i.txt..."
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/process/loan-application-$i.txt | jq '.status'
done
```

#### **Step 3: System Performance Check**
```bash
# Check system performance
curl -s http://localhost:8080/storage/status | jq '.file_counts'

# Check pod resource usage
kubectl top pods -l app=portfolio-demo

# Check cluster scaling
kubectl get nodes
```

**Expected Result:** System should handle multiple concurrent uploads and processing without performance degradation.

#### **Step 1: Pod Failure Simulation**
```bash
# Delete a pod to test auto-recovery
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=portfolio-demo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo "Deleting pod: $POD_NAME"
kubectl delete pod $POD_NAME

# Wait for pod to restart
echo "Waiting for pod to restart..."
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=portfolio-demo --timeout=300s

# Verify system is still functional
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq '.status'
```

#### **Step 2: Data Persistence Verification**
```bash
# Verify EFS data persistence
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=portfolio-demo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  -- ls -la /mnt/efs/uploads/ | wc -l

# Check if previous files are still accessible
curl -s http://localhost:8080/files | jq '.count'
```

##  **Expected Results Summary**

### ** Success Criteria for All Scenarios:**

1. **File Upload**: All documents upload successfully with proper metadata
2. **File Processing**: All documents process without errors
3. **Storage Persistence**: Files remain accessible after pod restarts
4. **Audit Logging**: All activities are logged with timestamps
5. **Error Handling**: System gracefully handles invalid requests
6. **Performance**: Response times under 100ms for health checks
7. **Scalability**: System handles multiple concurrent requests
8. **Monitoring**: All metrics and logs are accessible

### ** Troubleshooting Guide:**

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Pod Not Ready** | `kubectl get pods` shows NotReady | Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>` |
| **EFS Mount Failed** | Storage status shows `mounted: false` | Check EFS CSI driver: `kubectl get csidrivers` |
| **API Not Responding** | curl returns connection refused | Check port-forward: `kubectl port-forward` |
| **File Upload Fails** | 500 error on upload | Check disk space: `kubectl exec <pod> -- df -h` |
| **S3 Sync Errors** | Credential errors in logs | Check AWS credentials in secrets |

### **📞 Escalation Procedures:**

1. **Level 1**: Basic troubleshooting using this guide
2. **Level 2**: Check AWS console for resource status
3. **Level 3**: Review Terraform state and logs
4. **Level 4**: Contact AWS support for infrastructure issues
