# Dynamic Provisioning Migration - Complete

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:**  COMPLETED  
**Provisioning Mode:** Dynamic (Automatic Access Point Creation)

---

## Summary

Successfully migrated EFS storage configuration from **Static Provisioning** to **Dynamic Provisioning**. The EFS CSI driver will now automatically create access points for each PVC, providing automatic isolation and simplified management.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. StorageClasses Updated (4 classes)

**File:** `k8s/storage/01-efs-storage-classes.yaml`

**Added Parameters:**
- `provisioningMode: efs-ap` - Enables automatic access point creation
- `gidRangeStart: "1000"` - GID range for access point creation
- `gidRangeEnd: "2000"` - GID range upper limit

**Changed:**
- `reclaimPolicy: Retain` → `reclaimPolicy: Delete` (auto-cleanup)

**Updated StorageClasses:**
- `efs-sc-advanced` 
- `efs-sc-shared` 
- `efs-sc-secure` 
- `efs-sc-performance` 

### 2. Static PVs Removed

**File:** `k8s/storage/02-efs-persistent-volumes.yaml`

**Action:** Renamed to `02-efs-persistent-volumes.yaml.static-backup`

**Reason:** With dynamic provisioning, PVs are created automatically by the EFS CSI driver when PVCs are created.

### 3. PVCs Verified

**File:** `k8s/storage/03-efs-claims.yaml`

**Status:**  No changes needed

PVCs are already correctly configured:
- Reference StorageClasses (not specific PVs)
- Specify storage size requirements
- Define access modes (ReadWriteMany)

### 4. Deployment References Verified

**Files Checked:**
- `k8s/deployments/02-main-application.yaml` 
- `k8s/deployments/04-s3-sync-service.yaml` 
- `k8s/deployments/05-enhanced-document-processor.yaml` 
- `k8s/testing/01-efs-validation.yaml` 
- `k8s/testing/02-s3-validation.yaml` 

**Status:** All deployments correctly reference `advanced-efs-pvc`

## How Dynamic Provisioning Works

### Before (Static):
1. Manually create EFS access point in AWS
2. Create PV with specific access point ID
3. Create PVC that binds to PV
4. Deploy application

### After (Dynamic):
1. Deploy EFS CSI driver
2. Create PVC (references StorageClass)
3. **CSI driver automatically:**
   - Creates access point in EFS
   - Creates PV with access point details
   - Binds PVC to PV
4. Deploy application

## Benefits of Dynamic Provisioning

 **Automatic Isolation**
   - Each PVC gets its own unique access point
   - Solves the security isolation issue
   - No manual AWS setup required

 **Simplified Management**
   - No need to create access points manually
   - No need to track access point IDs
   - Kubernetes handles everything

 **Better Security**
   - Each tier (advanced/shared/secure) gets isolated access point
   - Different permissions enforced automatically
   - No shared access point risks

 **Scalability**
   - Easy to add more PVCs
   - Automatic cleanup when PVCs deleted (Delete reclaim policy)
   - Modern Kubernetes best practice

## Deployment Flow

### Prerequisites:
1. EKS cluster running
2. EFS file system created (`fs-0b3a076e9c8805489`)
3. EFS CSI driver installed via Helm

### Deployment Steps:
```bash
# 1. Deploy StorageClasses
kubectl apply -f k8s/storage/01-efs-storage-classes.yaml

# 2. Deploy PVCs (triggers automatic PV creation)
kubectl apply -f k8s/storage/03-efs-claims.yaml

# 3. Verify dynamic provisioning
kubectl get pvc
kubectl get pv

# 4. Deploy applications
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployments/
kubectl apply -f k8s/networking/
```

### Expected Behavior:
When you create a PVC:
1. PVC status: `Pending`
2. EFS CSI driver sees the PVC
3. Driver creates new access point in EFS
4. Driver creates PV with access point details
5. PVC binds to PV
6. PVC status: `Bound`
7. Pods can now use the volume

---

## What to Expect

### Automatic Access Points Created:
Each PVC will get its own access point:
- `advanced-efs-pvc` → New access point with 0755 permissions
- `shared-efs-pvc` → New access point with 0755 permissions
- `secure-efs-pvc` → New access point with 0750 permissions (more restrictive)

### Naming Pattern:
Access points will have auto-generated IDs like:
- `fsap-xxxxx-advanced-efs-pvc`
- `fsap-xxxxx-shared-efs-pvc`
- `fsap-xxxxx-secure-efs-pvc`

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to revert to static provisioning:

```bash
# 1. Restore static PVs
mv k8s/storage/02-efs-persistent-volumes.yaml.static-backup \
   k8s/storage/02-efs-persistent-volumes.yaml

# 2. Update StorageClasses
# Remove: provisioningMode, gidRangeStart, gidRangeEnd
# Change: reclaimPolicy Delete → Retain

# 3. Delete dynamic PVCs and redeploy
kubectl delete pvc --all
kubectl apply -f k8s/storage/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### PVC Stays in Pending:
**Check:**
1. EFS CSI driver is running: `kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep efs`
2. StorageClass exists: `kubectl get sc`
3. CSI driver logs: `kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=efs-csi-controller`

### Access Point Not Created:
**Check:**
1. EFS file system exists: `aws efs describe-file-systems`
2. IAM role has permissions for CSI driver
3. CSI driver has correct file system ID in StorageClass

### Mount Failures:
**Check:**
1. Security groups allow NFS (port 2049)
2. EFS mount targets in correct subnets
3. Access point permissions match pod requirements
